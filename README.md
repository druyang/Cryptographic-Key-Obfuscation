# CUDA-based Cryptographic Key Obfuscation
A novel implementation of program obfuscation that leverages the unique parallel programming paradigm offered by the CUDA GPGPU computing language to generate obscure and unintelligable binary when compiled, which may be more difficult to 'crack' than ordinary CPU-based obfuscated code. Inspired by the concept of [Translingual Obfuscation](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/wu//papers/to-eurosp16.pdf).
